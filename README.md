This McEnery Convention Center is a well known place where Apple welcomes developers, scholarship recipients, 
and others who purchased tickets to attend WWDC. WWDC is an acronym for Apple Worldwide Developers Conference. 
The Apple Worldwide Developers Conference is a conference held annually by Apple Inc.  Apple uses this annual 
event to showcase its new software and advanced technologies for Apple software developers. Individuals who did
not win via the lottery ticket system, via scholarship award are unable to attend WWDC, but they can watch WWDC
through Apple’s live streaming website. If you hate lounging around at home watching WWDC, or you would like some fresh air? Lucky for you WWDC offers open air viewing of the event outside the venue. You won’t miss a thing and
you’ll feel like you’re in the midst of the action just like those who won a lottery ticket or scholarship. There
is also a 3-D walk through of McEnery Convention center where you can view before the event begins. No chairs are
needed in this ARKit and you can stand to watch WWDC live (from WWDC live on the Apple website) from inside the McEnery 
Convention Center.
